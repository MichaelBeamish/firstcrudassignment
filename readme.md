## Your first crud!

Build your first crud app! Using what we learned yesterday create a full crud app for user objects. The objects should look like this:
{
  "id": "user id",*
  "name":"user name",
  "email": "user email",
  "state": "CA"
}

Here's a list of all the routes you'll need.
 - Create route for creating new users
 - Get route for getting all users
 - Get route for getting a user by id*
 - Update route for updating a user by id*
 - Delete route for deleting a user by id*


 ### Stretch:*
 Add an id field to the object and use that instead of name for all of your routes.
